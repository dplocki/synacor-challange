# Mirror Puzzle

We find the mirror and see the code written on our forehead.

Just to be sure, I simply post the the code which I received. It was not the correct one.

I post the exact reversed string, but it was not that obvious. I had to find and replace letters which have mirror-counterparts (like "b" and "d" etc).

The final code passed.
