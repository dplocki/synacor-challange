    ">Recent advances in interdimensional physics have produced fascinating\n",
    ">predictions about the fundamentals of our universe!  For example,\n",
    ">interdimensional physics seems to predict that the universe is, at its root, a\n",
    ">purely mathematical construct, and that all events are caused by the\n",
    ">interactions between eight pockets of energy called \"registers\".\n",
    ">Furthermore, it seems that while the lower registers primarily control mundane\n",
    ">things like sound and light, the highest register (the so-called \"eighth\n",
    ">register\") is used to control interdimensional events such as teleportation.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">A hypothetical such teleportation device would need to have have exactly two\n",
    ">destinations.  One destination would be used when the eighth register is at its\n",
    ">minimum energy level - this would be the default operation assuming the user\n",
    ">has no way to control the eighth register.  In this situation, the teleporter\n",
    ">should send the user to a preconfigured safe location as a default.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The second destination, however, is predicted to require a very specific\n",
    ">energy level in the eighth register.  The teleporter must take great care to\n",
    ">confirm that this energy level is exactly correct before teleporting its user!\n",
    ">If it is even slightly off, the user would (probably) arrive at the correct\n",
    ">location, but would briefly experience anomalies in the fabric of reality\n",
    ">itself - this is, of course, not recommended.  Any teleporter would need to test\n",
    ">the energy level in the eighth register and abort teleportation if it is not\n",
    ">exactly correct.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">This required precision implies that the confirmation mechanism would be very\n",
    ">computationally expensive.  While this would likely not be an issue for large-\n",
    ">scale teleporters, a hypothetical hand-held teleporter would take billions of\n",
    ">years to compute the result and confirm that the eighth register is correct.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">If you find yourself trapped in an alternate dimension with nothing but a\n",
    ">hand-held teleporter, you will need to extract the confirmation algorithm,\n",
    ">reimplement it on more powerful hardware, and optimize it.  This should, at the\n",
    ">very least, allow you to determine the value of the eighth register which would\n",
    ">have been accepted by the teleporter's confirmation mechanism.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Then, set the eighth register to this value, activate the teleporter, and\n",
    ">bypass the confirmation mechanism.  If the eighth register is set correctly, no\n",
    ">anomalies should be experienced, but beware - if it is set incorrectly, the\n",
    ">now-bypassed confirmation mechanism will not protect you!\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Of course, since teleportation is impossible, this is all totally ridiculous.\n",
